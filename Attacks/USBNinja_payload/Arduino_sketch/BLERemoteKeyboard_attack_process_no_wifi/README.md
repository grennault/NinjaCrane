## Description
This arduino script is a modification of the first version:
- Assumes malware is already present in the computer in `~/Desktop/Msalware/malwar3.exe`
- Can also write A or B in a text file to inform the running malware to stop the PLC for ex. 

## Explanations

I wrote this for demonstration purpose to avoid waiting for the malware to be downloaded.
