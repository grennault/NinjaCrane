ABSTRACT = {Assessing security awareness among users is essential for protecting industrial control systems (ICSs) from social engineering attacks. This research aimed to determine the effect of cyber security awareness on the emergency response to cyber security incidents in the ICS. Additionally, this study has adopted a variety of cyber security emergency response process measures and frameworks and comprehensively proposes a new organizational model of cyber security incident response. The corresponding measures are evaluated based on the MP2DR2 risk control matrix model to assess their practical value in the evaluation stage. This study found that after adding security awareness measures to response control measures, the influential value ranking of other control measures changed. The practical value of security awareness control measures was given a higher priority than that of other control measures. The research results highlight the importance of cyber security awareness and aim to inspire ICSs to place a higher priority on staff cyber security awareness in relation to cyber security incidents, which can effectively prevent the occurrence of cyber security incidents and make the field of industrial control application agency respond to incidents faster to restore the regular progress of all works.},

abstract = {Cyber-physical systems tightly integrate physical processes and information and communication technologies. As today's critical infrastructures, e.g., the power grid or water distribution networks, are complex cyber-physical systems, ensuring their safety and security becomes of paramount importance. Traditional safety analysis methods, such as HAZOP, are ill-suited to assess these systems. Furthermore, cybersecurity vulnerabilities are often not considered critical, because their effects on the physical processes are not fully understood. In this work, we present STPA-SafeSec, a novel analysis methodology for both safety and security. Its results show the dependencies between cybersecurity vulnerabilities and system safety. Using this information, the most effective mitigation strategies to ensure safety and security of the system can be readily identified. We apply STPA-SafeSec to a use case in the power grid domain, and highlight its benefits.}

abstract = {Research efforts in the security of Industrial Control Systems (ICS) have dramatically increased over the past few years. However, there is a limiting factor when work cannot be evaluated on real-world systems due to safety and operational reasons. This has led to multiple deployments of ICS testbeds covering multiple sectors including water treatment, power distribution and transportation networks.Over the last five years, we have designed and constructed ICS testbeds to support cyber security research. Our prior work in building testbeds culminated in a set of design principles and lessons learnt, formulated to support other researchers in designing and building their own ICS testbeds. In the last two years we have taken these lessons and used them to guide our own greenfield large-scale, complex and process-diverse security testbed affording a rare opportunity to design and build from the ground up -- one in which we have been able to look back and validate those past lessons and principles.In this work we describe the process of building our new ICS and Industrial Internet of Things (IIoT) testbed, and give an overview of its architecture. We then reflect on our past lessons, and contribute five previously unrecognised additional lessons based on this experience.},

abstract="Industrial Control Systems (ICS) play an important role in the monitoring, control and automation of critical infrastructure such as water, gas, oil and electricity. Recent years have seen a number of high profile cyber attacks on such infrastructure exemplified by Stuxnet and the Ukrainian Power Grid attacks. This naturally begs the question: how should we manage cyber security risks in such infrastructure on which the day-to-day functioning of societies rely? What are the complexities of managing security in a landscape shaped by the often competing demands of a variety of stakeholders, e.g., managers, control engineers, enterprise IT personnel and field site operators? What are the challenges posed by the convergence of Internet of Things (IoT) and critical infrastructure through the so-called Industrial Internet of Things (IIoT)? In this paper, we discuss insights from a multi-year programme of research investigating these issues and the challenges to addressing them.",

In this survey, we review 29 different USB-based attacks and utilize our new taxonomy to classify them into four major categories. These attacks target both individuals and organizations; utilize widely used USB peripherals, such as keyboards, mice, flash drives, smartphones etc. For each attack, we address the objective it achieves and identify the associated and vulnerable USB peripherals and hardware.}

abstract = {USB attacks are becoming more sophisticated. Rather than using USB devices solely as a delivery mechanism for host-side exploits, attackers are targeting the USB stack itself, embedding malicious code in device firmware to covertly request additional USB interfaces, providing unacknowledged and malicious functionality that lies outside the apparent purpose of the device. This allows for attacks such as BadUSB, where a USB storage device with malicious firmware is capable of covertly acting as a keyboard as well, allowing it to inject malicious scripts into the host machine. We observe that the root cause of such attacks is that the USB Stack exposes a set of unrestricted device privileges and note that the most reliable information about a device's capabilities comes from the end user's expectation of the device's functionality. We design and implement GoodUSB, a mediation architecture for the Linux USB Stack. We defend against BadUSB attacks by enforcing permissions based on user expectations of device functionality. GoodUSB includes a security image component to simplify use, and a honeypot mechanism for observing suspicious USB activities. GoodUSB introduces only 5.2\% performance overhead compared to the unmodified Linux USB subsystem. It is an important step forward in defending against USB attacks and towards allowing the safe deployment of USB devices in the enterprise.},

Based on social cognitive theory, this study models and tests relationships among self-efficacy in information security, security practice behavior and motivation to strengthen security efforts. This study also explores antecedents to individuals' self-efficacy beliefs in information security. Results provide support for the many hypothesized relationships. This study provides an initial step toward understanding of the applicability of social cognitive theory in a new domain of information security. The results suggest that simply listing what not to do and penalties associated with a wrong doing in the users' information security policy alone will have a limited impact on effective implementation of security measures. The findings may help information security professionals design security awareness programs that more effectively increase the self-efficacy in information security.}

Theorizing from the Protection Motivation Theory, 200 Small and Medium Enterprises (SMEs) were contacted to understand their perception of cybersecurity and policy awareness in affecting their overall cybersecurity hygiene. Data collection was carried out using a questionnaire survey and analysed via Partial Least Squares-based Structural Equation Modelling to validate the research framework. Results of analysis outlined the importance of general cybersecurity and policy awareness in shifting employees’ compliance attitude towards enhancing supply chain reactive capability. Using a mixed-method approach, post-survey interviews were further conducted with practitioners in SMEs to understand the study findings. The implications outlined in this study emphasises the importance of prioritising preventive measures and proper employee cyber hygiene to address the risk and loss following a cyber-attack. Key supply chain operational areas in SMEs are still largely supported by the human workforce serving as its backbone. An unwarranted attack could cause adverse business impacts. Thus, practitioners and SMEs would be alerted to the critical need for a robust security posture and that SMEs’ need of the hour lies at the core of its policy and employee cybersecurity hygiene.}

abstract = {The general problem is that complexity of integrated circuit (IC) production has increased vulnerability to manipulation by cybercriminals (Xue et al., 2020; Fisher et al., 2011). The IC manufacturing system is susceptible to counterfeiting (Goertzel, 2013; Lahmar et al., 2016). The global nature of the IC production process makes it difficult to identify where and when unauthorized alterations may occur. Assessing trustworthiness of each supply chain point is challenging, especially when replication, reverse engineering, recycling, or relabeling can occur at various points (Salmani, 2018). The specific problem is that insertion of hardware Trojans in FPGAs and ASICs results in unauthorized data disclosure and/or compromission of the system (Xue et al., 2020; Fisher et al., 2011). This quantitative survey research study's main purpose is to understand the relationship between vulnerabilities in IC's SDLC and compromised end-product. The research used a correlational design to evaluate this relationship. Based on this research data, correlations between perceived vulnerability and the likelihood of compromised end product show statistically significant results across all six phases of IC SDLC.},

ABSTRACT = {The possibility of cyber-attacks against critical infrastructure, and in particular nuclear power plants, has prompted several efforts by academia. Many of these works aim to capture the vulnerabilities of the industrial control systems used in these plants through computer simulations and hardware in the loop configurations. However, general results in this area are limited by the cost and diversity of existing commercial equipment and protocols, as well as by the inherent complexity of the nuclear plants. In this context, this work introduces a testbed for the study of cyber-attacks against a realistic simulation of a nuclear power plant. Our approach consists in surveying issues regarding realistic simulations of nuclear power plants and to design and experimentally validate a software testbed for the controlled analysis of cyberattacks against the simulated nuclear plant. The proposal integrates a simulated Modbus/TCP network environment containing basic industrial control elements implemented with open-source software components. We validate the proposed testbed architecture by performing and analyzing a representative cyberattack in the developed environment, thus showing the principles for the analysis of other possible cybernetic attacks.},

These labs are built using a Hardware-In-the-Loop simulation system of the physical process developed by the two partners. The cyber-ranges allow replication of realistic Advanced Persistent Threat (APT) attacks and demonstration of known vulnerabilities, as they rely on real industrial control devices and softwares. In this work, we present both the demonstration scenarios used for awareness on WonderICS and the training programs developed for graduate students on G-ICS.},

abstract = {For decades Supervisory Control and Data Acquisition (SCADA) and Industrial Control Systems (ICS) have used computers to monitor and control physical processes in many critical industries, including electricity generation, gas pipelines, water distribution, waste treatment, communications and transportation. Increasingly these systems are interconnected with corporate networks via the Internet, making them vulnerable and exposed to the same risks as those experiencing cyber-attacks on a conventional network. Very often SCADA networks services are viewed as a specialty subject, more relevant to engineers than standard IT personnel. Educators from two Australian universities have recognised these cultural issues and highlighted the gap between specialists with SCADA systems engineering skills and the specialists in network security with IT background. This paper describes a learning approach designed to help students to bridge this gap, gain theoretical knowledge of SCADA systems' vulnerabilities to cyber-attacks via experiential learning and acquire practical skills through actively participating in hands-on exercises.}

This fact exacerbates the global issue of hiring cybersecurity employees with relevant skills. In this paper, we present KYPO4INDUSTRY training facility and a course syllabus for beginner and intermediate computer science students to learn cybersecurity in a simulated industrial environment. The training facility is built using open-source hardware and software and provides reconfigurable modules of industrial control systems. The course uses a flipped classroom format with hands-on projects: the students create educational games that replicate real cyber attacks. Throughout the semester, they learn to understand the risks and gain capabilities to respond to cyber attacks that target industrial control systems. Our described experience from the design of the testbed and its usage can help any educator interested in teaching cybersecurity of cyber-physical systems.},

abstract = {Physical testbeds offer the ability to test out cybersecurity practices, which may be dangerous to implement in a real-life scenario. They also provide a means to educate students and researchers on effective cyber-defence practices. However, the majority of existing non-virtualised physical testbeds are costly, inaccessible, and are often location constrained. As such, modern education and research for control system security is becoming increasingly reliant on virtualised labs and tools. Any learning or research undertaken using these tools, however, is based around the limitations and characteristics of such tools, as well as any assumptions made by their developers. Virtual testbeds are not perfect. Additionally, the accuracy of data resulting from emulations and models may be further decreased if used outside of their intended usage scenario. As such, this paper presents a discussion on the effectiveness of physical testbeds over simulation approaches. In addition, an approach for the design and construction of a replicable, cost-effective testbed for cyber-security education and training is presented.}

abstract = {This paper presents a supervisory control and data acquisition (SCADA) testbed recently built at the University of New Orleans. The testbed consists of models of three industrial physical processes: a gas pipeline, a power transmission and distribution system, and a wastewater treatment plant--these systems are fully-functional and implemented at small-scale. It utilizes real-world industrial equipment such as transformers, programmable logic controllers (PLC), aerators, etc., bringing it closer to modeling real-world SCADA systems. Sensors, actuators, and PLCs are deployed at each physical process system for local control and monitoring, and the PLCs are also connected to a computer running human-machine interface (HMI) software for monitoring the status of the physical processes. The testbed is a useful resource for cybersecurity research, forensic research, and education on different aspects of SCADA systems such as PLC programming, protocol analysis, and demonstration of cyber attacks.},
